In React, a "context" erfers to a feature that provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. In a typical React app, data is passed top-down (parent to child) via props. This can be cumbersome for certain types of props, e.g. local preference, UI theme, that may be required by many componnents in the app. Context provides a way to share values like these between components without having to explicitly pass a prop through every level of the tree.

In this directory, please keep all app contexts.
